   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, fallback modes, retry logic

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Risk: Predictions and reality diverge
   - Mitigation: Continuous validation, feedback loops, model updates

4. **System Reliability**
   - Risk: Single points of failure
   - Mitigation: Health checks, graceful degradation, redundancy

### Contingency Plans
