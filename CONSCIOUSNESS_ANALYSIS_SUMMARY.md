## 🔧 1. Dashboard Compatibility Fix

### Issue Identified
- Dash framework compatibility issue: `app.run_server` was deprecated in favor of `app.run`
- Error occurred during dashboard startup in the demo

### Solution Implemented
- Updated `monitoring/consciousness_dashboard.py` line 631
- Changed `self.app.run_server(...)` to `self.app.run(...)`
- Verified fix with comprehensive test script

### Result
✅ **Dashboard now fully compatible with current Dash version**
✅ **Ready for future multi-agent consciousness demonstrations**
