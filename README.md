## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Cognitive Cycles (CC) Economy

Kairos operates on an internal economy where **Cognitive Cycles** serve as the fundamental currency:

- **Earning CC**: Agents earn CC by successfully completing tasks
- **Spending CC**: Agents invest CC to bid on tasks and access resources  
- **Market Dynamics**: CC prices fluctuate based on supply, demand, and agent performance
- **Emergent Specialization**: Agents naturally specialize in areas where they earn more CC

### Causal Decision Ledger

Every decision made within Kairos is recorded with full causal traceability:

```python
await agent.record_decision(
    venture_id="venture_123",
    decision_type=DecisionType.STRATEGIC,
    triggered_by_event="market_volatility_detected",
    rationale="Scaling infrastructure proactively based on Oracle predictions",
    confidence_level=0.87,
    expected_outcomes={"cost_savings": 15000, "performance_improvement": "25%"},
    cc_invested=250
)
```

### Agent Bidding System

Tasks are allocated through a sophisticated bidding mechanism:

1. **Task Posted**: A venture posts a task with CC bounty
2. **Agent Evaluation**: Agents evaluate task fit using ML models
3. **Intelligent Bidding**: Agents submit bids based on capability, market conditions, and risk
4. **Smart Assignment**: Best bid wins considering multiple factors
5. **Execution**: Winning agent executes task with performance tracking
6. **Settlement**: Payment and reputation updates occur automatically

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Development

Create your own specialized agents by extending the cognitive substrate:

```python
from agents.enhanced.agent_base import KairosAgentBase, AgentType

class MySpecializedAgent(KairosAgentBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            agent_name="My-Specialized-Agent",
            agent_type=AgentType.CUSTOM,
            specialization="Custom Domain Intelligence",
            initial_cc_balance=2000
        )
    
    async def evaluate_task_fit(self, task: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
        # Implement your task evaluation logic
        return fit_score
    
    async def generate_task_bid(self, task: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[TaskBid]:
        # Implement your bidding strategy
        return bid
    
    async def process_task(self, task: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implement your task processing logic
        return result
```

### Infrastructure Automation

The Enhanced Steward can autonomously provision infrastructure:

```python
# Infrastructure provisioning via Steward
steward = EnhancedStewardAgent()
await steward.provision_infrastructure({
    'environment': 'production',
    'expected_load': 100000,
    'budget_limit': 5000,
    'regions': ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']
})
```

### Simulation and Forecasting

Leverage The Oracle for strategic insights:

```python
# Run market simulation
oracle = PreCognitiveSimulationEngine()
simulation_result = await oracle.run_market_simulation({
    'user_segments': ['premium', 'standard', 'basic'],
    'time_horizon_days': 90,
    'market_conditions': 'volatile',
    'new_features': ['ai_assistant', 'mobile_app']
})

# Analyze black swan resilience  
resilience_test = await oracle.inject_black_swan_event({
    'event_type': 'supply_chain_disruption',
    'severity': 0.8,
    'duration_days': 30
})
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Observability

Kairos exports comprehensive metrics:

- `kairos_agent_tasks_completed_total`
- `kairos_cognitive_cycles_balance`  
- `kairos_decision_time_seconds`
- `kairos_simulation_accuracy_ratio`
- `kairos_infrastructure_cost_usd`

### Dashboard Integration

Pre-built Grafana dashboards provide real-time insights:

- **Agent Performance**: Task completion rates, CC balances, specialization trends
- **Economic Health**: CC circulation, bid/ask spreads, market efficiency
- **Infrastructure Status**: Resource utilization, cost optimization, scaling events
- **Simulation Accuracy**: Prediction vs. reality comparisons, model drift detection

### Log Aggregation

Structured logging with correlation IDs across all components:

```python
logger.info(
    "Task completed successfully",
    extra={
        "agent_id": self.agent_id,
        "task_id": task_id,
        "cc_earned": reward_amount,
        "quality_score": 0.94,
        "correlation_id": correlation_id
    }
)
```
