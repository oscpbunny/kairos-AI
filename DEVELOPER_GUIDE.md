agents = {
    "Product Manager": {
        "specializations": ["strategy", "user_research", "market_analysis"],
        "perspective": "Business value and user impact"
    },
    "Senior Developer": {
        "specializations": ["architecture", "performance", "security"],
        "perspective": "Technical feasibility and scalability"
    },
    "UX Designer": {
        "specializations": ["usability", "accessibility", "design_systems"],
        "perspective": "User experience and interface design"
    },
    "QA Engineer": {
        "specializations": ["testing", "quality_assurance", "automation"],
        "perspective": "Quality, reliability, and edge cases"
    }
}
```

### Custom Product Scenarios
```python
scenarios = [
    "Evaluate mobile-first redesign impact on user engagement",
    "Assess technical debt priorities for next quarter",
    "Analyze competitor feature comparison for strategic planning",
    "Plan microservices migration for better scalability",
    "Design onboarding flow optimization strategy"
]
```

## ðŸ“Š Analytics Integration

### Custom Metrics Tracking
```python
# Track your product-specific metrics
metrics = {
    "user_engagement": 0.85,
    "feature_adoption": 0.72,
    "technical_debt_score": 0.35,
    "team_velocity": 0.90,
    "user_satisfaction": 0.88
}
```

### Dashboard Configuration
```python
# monitoring/custom_product_dashboard.py
dashboard_config = {
    "metrics": ["sprint_velocity", "bug_rate", "user_retention"],
    "alerts": ["performance_degradation", "error_rate_spike"],
    "reports": ["weekly_team_sync", "monthly_product_review"]
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

**Collaboration Quality Scores:**
- 0.80+: Excellent multi-perspective alignment
- 0.70-0.79: Good collaborative analysis
- 0.60-0.69: Acceptable team coordination
- <0.60: Needs improvement in perspective diversity

**System Performance:**
- Real-time dashboard updates (5-second refresh)
- Sub-second agent response times
- 99.9% system availability
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## ðŸ”„ Integration Options

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```bash
# Add to your build pipeline
python kairos/automation/feature_analysis.py --feature="new_checkout_flow"
```

### Slack/Teams Integration  
```bash
# Product team notifications
python integrations/slack_notifier.py --channel="product-updates" --analysis="feature_prioritization"
```

### Jira/GitHub Integration
```bash
# Automatic ticket analysis and prioritization
python integrations/jira_analyzer.py --project="PROD" --sprint="current"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic multi-agent analysis before complex workflows
2. **Customize Gradually:** Add product-specific agents and scenarios over time
3. **Monitor Quality:** Track collaboration scores to ensure effective multi-agent coordination
4. **Regular Reviews:** Use analytics to continuously improve your product development process
5. **Team Training:** Ensure your team understands how to interpret multi-agent analysis results

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Agents not coordinating:** Check system coherence scores in dashboard
- **Low collaboration quality:** Verify agent role specializations are distinct
- **Dashboard not loading:** Ensure ports 8050/8051 are available
- **API errors:** Check logs in monitoring dashboard

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor system resource usage during multi-agent coordination
- Adjust agent complexity based on available computational resources
- Use caching for frequently analyzed scenarios
- Scale horizontally for larger team analysis needs
